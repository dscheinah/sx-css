# sx-css

Core CSS framework used in sx applications.

This is no PHP module. To use this package you probably need to do some extra configuration to move the files and setup build routines. An example can be found and used at https://github.com/dscheinah/sx-skeleton.

Usage can be derived from the test sources.
